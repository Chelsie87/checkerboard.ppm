# checkerboard.ppm

Prompt:
Draw a 768 x 768 chessboard on a 800 x 800 white canvas, using red and yellow colors.  Note the board will be composed of 96 x 96 squares of red and yellow colors, respectively.
Repeat the assignment using different colors, such as black and white.

As I learned about .ppm images, I created a simple checkerboard output and played with the RGB values. 
I added respective outputs, but the code will create the .ppm images (labeled checkerboard.ppm and checkerboard_2.ppm).
